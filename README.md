# Forking

This code can be used by anyone that needs it for their own website although it comes at a price..._attribution_. Plagiarism is bad, it's not right to use someone's work without giving them the credit they deserve. A lot of effort and time were put into the design and development of this website, do not attempt to claim this as your own because if you do, it means you claimed my effort and time as yours as well which is wrong.

This website is not developed with the intention of it being for starters. The code is commented, all right but fairly. If you have questions, you can get in touch with me or look it up on platforms like _StackOverflow_ and _Quora_.

# TL; DR

You can fork this repo and even use the code but please, give me proper credit by linking back to my [GitHub - devwraithe](https://www.github.com/devwraithe) or [Website - DevWraithe](https://devwraithe.web.app). Thanks!!!

# Installation

Since this is a vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript website, all you need to do is download the wbsite folder and fire away. you'll also find that all the plugins used are local, it's not compulsory to download anything unless you want to. Additionally, this website is hosted using _Google Firebase_ so you might find some unfamiliar files if you're not familiar with Google Firebase. Happy Tweaking!!!
